## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried becoming more comfortable with SCSS features such as `@for`, `@mixins` and `@if`. These at-rules were very useful in reducing the amount of animations code.

### Continued development

I am focusing on improving my styling skills and learning React.
